11.18.10, Melissa, Apollo Beach, (11.18.10, 5:42am, male, didn't jump, taken away), This morning I was driving across the skyway. There was a silver smaller car. The suicide attempter was a young male with a small silver car. There were several rescue vehicles. The man was leaning on the concrete side wall. He looked as if they had saved him. Thank God!
